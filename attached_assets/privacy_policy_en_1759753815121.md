### Data Storage and Security

**Local-First Architecture:**

- Cloud sync allows you to access your data across multiple devices

**Data Encryption:**
- All sensitive data is encrypted both locally and in cloud storage
- Authentication tokens are stored securely using platform-specific secure storage
- Financial calculations and personal data are protected with industry-standard encryption

### Data Sharing

We may share your personal information in the following limited situations:

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Law Enforcement

Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).

- **Privacy by Design**: The app is designed to work offline with optional cloud features

However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
